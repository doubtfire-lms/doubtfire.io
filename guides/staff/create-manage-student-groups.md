the types of groups you can have in a unit. To setup a group set:

1. Log in to Doubtfire.

1. Select Manage Units from the Administration dropdown:

   - **Name:** The name of the group set, by default this is "Group Work"
   - **Create Groups:** Who has permissions to create new groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.

   - **Restrict to Tutorials:** if true, only students from the same tutorial can be in a group.
