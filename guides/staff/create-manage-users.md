User accounts in Doubtfire include both students and staff accounts, and there are two ways to create user accounts --
manually and batch.

# Editing an Existing User

Log in to Doubtfire and select _Manage Users_ from the Administration dropdown in the top right menu:

![Manage Users](/guides/create-manage-users/manage-users.png)

To edit an existing user, select the user in the list, and this will open the _edit user_ modal.

![Edit User](/guides/create-manage-users/edit-users.png)

From this menu, you can edit the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Avatar
- System Role (Student | Tutor | Convenor/Unit Chair | Administrator).

# Creating a New User

From the Manage Users page, click the _Add New User_ button on the bottom right to open the _Create User_ modal. This is
identical to the edit user modal previously discussed, however you can also set the username of the account:

**Note:** Setting a username is permanent, and can not be changed.

# Batch Import/Export Users

Users can be batch imported and exported by using a CSV file. To find the format of the CSV to be uploaded, you can
click the _download_ button in the users export panel to view the format, even if there are no users enrolled.
