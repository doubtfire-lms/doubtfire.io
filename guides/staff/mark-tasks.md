Marking student submissions in Doubtfire is done throughout the "Task Inbox" page. The Task Inbox is the default view
after logging in to Doubtfire, and selecting a unit.

1. Log in to Doubtfire and select the unit from the "Units You Teach" list:

1. The task inbox is divided into 3 panels:

   1. Task List, the left panel
   1. The Submission, the center panel
   1. The Comments, the right panel.

1. To mark a submission, select the task from the task list, and view the submission in the center panel. There are a
   number of possible states you can place the task on, which are located on the bottom of the submission panel. In
   sequence of appearance these include:

   - Fail
   - Mark As Feedback Exceeded
   - Redo
   - Fix and Resubmit
   - Discuss
   - Demonstrate
   - Complete

   A description of each of these states can be read by hovering your mouse over the state:

1. Leave a comment. At any time during this process, you can leave a written, audio or image comment on the task. These
   comments are specific to each individual task between the teaching staff and the student. To leave an audio comment,
   simply click the _microphone_ icon, and click "record". Ensure you are using a modern browser if audio comments are
   not working. Image comments can be uploaded by dragging the image into the comment field, and clicking send.
