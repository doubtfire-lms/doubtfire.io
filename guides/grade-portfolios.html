Switch to the **Student Portfolios** section in the staff view to start assessing student portfolios. This page\n   should contains all of the necessary details to perform the assessments.\n\n1. The **Select Student** tab is focused on selecting the student. The body of the page contains a list of students,\n   their target grades, task status, and awarded numeric grade.\n\n1.
