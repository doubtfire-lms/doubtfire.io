All of these actions take place in the student tab of the unit administration page

From the students page, you can perform the various student administration tasks.

## Batch Enroll/Withdraw
The batch enrollment section is located on the right hand side of the page. You can batch enroll students by dropping a CSV file with the student details. To view the format of the CSV required, simply download the current student enrollment (even if there are no enrolled students), to view the format and fields required.

1. Select the blue **Batch Enroll** or red **Batch Withdraw** button in the batch upload panel
1. Simply drag and drop the batch CSV, or select the dotted upload block to open a file navigator.
1. After processing, Doubtfire will alert you to any incorrect fields/errors.

## Manually Enroll
To manually enroll a student, select the green **Enroll Student** button on the bottom right-hand side of the page, and simply enter the student ID and tutorial code.

*Note*: The student account must already be created in Doubtfire, you can ensure this by asking the student to log in once.
*Note*: If the Tutorial Code is left blank (if not yet known), the student will still be enrolled, however no tutorial will be assigned.

## Manually Withdraw
To withdraw a student from the unit in Doubtfire, simply click the green tick box in the "Enrolled" column for the appropriate student:

## View or Change Student Allocation

The student class/tutorial allocation is listed in the "tutorial" column, with a dropdown box highlighting the currently assigned tutorial code. For example, in the image above, student_23 is enrollde in LA1-01 (Lab 1).

To change this allocation, simply select the dropdown box and change the tutorial to one of the options presented:
